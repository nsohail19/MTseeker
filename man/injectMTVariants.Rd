\title{Inject (one or more) variants against rCRS.}
\usage{
injectMTVariants(mvr, gr = NULL, refX = 1, altX = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{mvr}{An MVRanges, usually from callMT, often subsetted}

\item{gr}{A GRanges, usually of protein-coding regions (the default)}

\item{refX}{Reference depth below which variant is deemed canonical (1)}

\item{altX}{Alternative depth above which variants deemed canonical (1)}

\item{aa}{Attempt to translate codon(s) affected by variant(s)? (TRUE)}

\item{canon}{Minimum VAF to treat variants as canonical by subject (0.99)}
}
\value{
The GRanges, with ref/var DNA and AA and
}
\description{
FIXME: this function could most likely be orders of magnitude faster.
FIXME: this ONLY considers variants injected against rCRS, not RSRS or hg19.

\examples{
library(MTseekerData)
RO_2 <- RONKSvariants[["RO_2"]]
injectMTVariants(RO_2)
